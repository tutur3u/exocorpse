## DISCLAIMER

By purchasing my services (art & writing), you automatically agree to the following conditions.

If you are uncomfortable with my TOS and/or unwilling to agree to the conditions, you may not request a commission.

Usage for AI purposes and alike is strictly forbidden. Please do not upload it to any AI sites, or upload it to train AI algorithms, as this could compromise my artwork. Any attempt of this will result in immediate legal action.

NFT usage is strictly forbidden, and I will take immediate legal action if caught.

If you have any questions or problems, please contact me directly.

## GENERAL

By commissioning me, you are purchasing my service as an artist / writer only.

I reserve the right to post your finished artwork in my gallery for any reason.

I reserve the right to decline any project or client for any reason.

I reserve the right to refund you the full amount paid if I no longer wish to work on your project for any reason.

Clients who have commissioned and/or received work before this TOS has gone into effect are still bound to its contents.

These clients are permitted to include signatures and/or watermarks indicating the artwork is my intellectual property. Credit is mandatory, aside from Full Commercial Bypass rights.

By placing an order, you agree to these terms and conditions. Please read these terms carefully.

## ADD-ONS

Add-ons are when your commission has external requirements to be made, which are fully dependent on your request.

The following cases are considered necessary for add-ons: Colors for a sketch commission, complex designs, extra characters, revisions, etc.

In the case of a complex design, I will charge around 10% extra, depending on how many details there are in your design. However, I reserve the right to charge more if I deem fit.

In the case of an extra character: I will charge around 70% extra, which caps at 3 total. However, if you request more than 3, you must inform me of such.

In the case of revisions, revisions during sketches are free and unlimited, while the final version gets one free revision before having to pay +5 USD for each revision after.

## COMMERCIAL

If you wish to order a commission for commercial use, the total price of the commission, as well as any other royalties, will be agreed upon upfront.

Commercial use falls into making a profit from my artwork, while personal use does not.

The minimum price increases by +100% (2x) of the original price (after add-ons). However, I reserve the right to charge more if I deem fit.

- 2X (+100%) Commercial Package allows you the basic commercial use for streaming and nothing else. You are not permitted to use the artwork for merchandise if you've purchased this pack. You are prioritized and will be placed on top for the next commissions. You will still need to credit me for my work.
- 2.5X (+150%) Commercial Package allows you advanced commercial use for merchandise, reselling, and nothing else. You are not permitted to use the artwork for streaming if you've purchased this pack. You are prioritized and will be placed on top for the next commissions. You no longer need to credit me from this package onward, although it is appreciated if you still do.
- 3X (+200%) Commercial Package allows you full commercial use for streaming, merchandise, reselling, advertisement, and everything in between. Your commissions get prioritized and placed on top, and you bypass the need to credit me for the artwork, although it is appreciated if you still do. Additionally, the next time you purchase the same service that you purchased with this commercial use last time, you will not have to pay the commercial fee again, except for illustrations which you will need to repurchase after a year.

The following cases are considered commercial use: Reproducing and selling the artwork, publicly or privately; streaming and content uses; cases where you receive profit from a medium/platform where you have posted my artwork (eg. Patreon, YouTube, Twitch, a business website, business cards, etc).

The Full Commercial Package only applies per service. You will still need to repurchase it for any other service. Emotes, however, are cross-shared, meaning if you buy the package from a normal emote service, it will also work for pop-it emotes.

## NOT SAFE FOR WORK

If you wish to order a commission that falls into the NSFW category, the total price of the commission, as well as any other royalties, will be agreed upon upfront.

Before you place an NSFW commission, I will need you to verify that you are 18+ before we continue. If you are -18, the commission will automatically be cancelled, and you will be put on blacklist for a certain amount of time.

The minimum price will increase by +50%, adding to the base price. However, I reserve the right to charge more if I deem fit.

The following cases are considered NSFW: Nudity (eg, artistic nudity or sexual nudity), pornography, gore imagery, fetish artworks, etc.

I will not accept cases of NSFW where fetish comes into play, as that makes me uncomfortable. Additionally, I will automatically reject any request that might involve children. If your request makes me uncomfortable, I will inform you of such.

## NDA PRIVACY

If you wish to make your commission private, you must inform me beforehand, as I post all my commissions publicly.

Informing me not to post after the commission has been finished will put you at risk of being blacklisted unless you are willing to pay the remaining costs through boosting.

The minimum price will increase by +50%, adding to the base price. However, I reserve the right to charge more if I deem fit.

The following cases are eligible for NDA: Wanting your commission to be kept private, wanting me to post at a later date instead of after completion, wanting your name to be placed as anonymous, etc.

## COMMUNICATION

All communications must be held via VGen Messages, Email, or Discord, with VGen Messages and Discord being the priority.

I do not accept any other social media platforms, as I am not obligated to create an entirely new account to contact you.

Once you have sent me a commission, regardless of whether it was paid or not, I will contact you. If you do not respond within 48 hours, this will put you at risk of being blacklisted. Please be responsible with your communications.

Communications must only be in either English or Vietnamese, with English being the preferred language.

If you have difficulties speaking either language, please use a translator for inquiries.

During communications, I will analyze how your behavior is and act accordingly to ensure maximum comfort for both sides. If you switch randomly, I might be uncomfortable, as I am autistic. Please note beforehand.

## PAYMENT

My commissions function through VGen Payments and ONLY that, please make sure to have a working credit card before placing an order with me.

Payment will need to be sent in full upfront. In the case of large orders (200$+), milestone payment can be applied if the client requests.

Clients will be required to pay the full amount for the commission within 48 hours, up to 72 hours after I send the commission proposal.

Failure to pay for the proposal in time will result in the commission being automatically canceled or an additional 20% fee for late payment if the client wishes to extend.

In the case of an extension payment, I allow up to an additional week. If the client fails to pay by the extension, the commission will be automatically declined. If this happens, you are at risk of being blacklisted.

Once the payment has been made, I will request to have the funds released early. Everything in "Refunds & Chargebacks" will still be effective.

There will be a 10% additional tax fee to cover transaction and currency conversion fees. I can't remove this ,as it takes away a portion of my fees if I do, so please note beforehand.

All international clients are required to commission me through VGen, while Vietnamese residents can contact me directly for Bank Transfers.

## CALCULATIONS

If you want to calculate how much you'll be paying, you can continue to read further ahead.

The order with a (*) means that it's important and that it's always included. As for the other options, please add or remove them depending on what you require in your commission.

How to calculate: Base Price + _%/$ = Price you're looking for.

The order of calculation:

1. Base price*

2. Add-ons

3. NSFW (+50%)

4. NDA Privacy (+50%)

5. Commercial Price** (depends on package)

6. Discount** (-any%)

7. Service Tax* (+10%)

** Applies only to the overall price & before tax.

## COPYRIGHT & USAGE

I reserve the right to sign and / or watermark my own work. I will send you a full-resolution image without a watermark, along with one that does.

I retain all copyright over my work, which includes the right to redistribute, reproduce, or use the image as a sample for sales or self-promotion unless otherwise agreed upon.

You are not allowed to edit, claim, or trace my artwork, even if you've paid for my work.

In the case of a commission, I will not claim the rights to a character design unless it was one of my own designs.

In the case of an adoptable design, I will not reuse / resell the rights to the design once ownership is transferred to you.

In the case of a private commission, I will not post it if you have paid the NDA fee.

## TURN-AROUND TIME

Turnaround time will be between 3 days up to a month or two, depending on the type of commission.

I will start on the artwork once I have received the full payment. You may reserve a slot with me for a commission in the future.

Adjustments can only be made during the sketch (and minor details can be made after completion).

You, the client, reserve the right to set a deadline. The deadline must be discussed before payment.

I have the right to deny said deadline if it is too short and I am uncomfortable with the set deadline.

You may ask me occasionally for progress but do not harass me for progress every day. I will provide updates on any major milestones.

## RUSH DEPOSIT FEES

If the deadline is urgent from the time you sent in payment, a Rush Fee will be put into place.

Rush Fees mean your order will be put into priority, placed atop of everyone else.

If your Rush Fee deadline is before one of the other pending Rush Fees, I will place your commission first; otherwise, it will stay in line.

Rush Fees are +40-60% of the total commission fee, depending on the range and time limit.

If under any circumstances I can not finish the order within the time limit, I will refund your Rush Fee. Otherwise, it will not be refunded for any reason.

If you have paid for the Rush Deposit Fee and wish for it to be canceled, I will not refund said fee, as it is meant to be a deposit.

## REFUNDS & CHARGEBACKS

I can only refund 100% if I have yet to start working on the sketch, which only applies if full payment was made upfront.

There will absolutely be no refunds once the draft has been confirmed and I have been sent payment.

If I can't finish the commission within the deadline, I will refund 50%, including the lost fees during the currency exchange.

If I can't finish the commission because I am unable to do it justice, I will refund you 100% if I made no progress and 80% if I made some progress, including the lost fees during the currency exchange.

You are not authorized to issue a chargeback for any reason.

If, for any reason, your account malfunctions or authorizes a refund request without your knowledge, you must contact me as soon as possible in order to resolve the issue.

You are required to contact me when you need to cancel a commission request.

Purposefully issuing a chargeback without contacting me to cancel / refund a project will result in immediate blacklisting for you as well as your email address, and anyone sharing your account, including side accounts.

## BLACKLIST

Being blacklisted means that you are forbidden from purchasing any of my products, commission services and so forth. This also means that you are blocked and avoided, and any attempt to commission me will automatically be rejected.

The following cases put you at risk of being blacklisted: Late payment after extension; unwarranted chargebacks; inconsistent communication; you being an awful person for any reason; constant harassment during communications; you fit my DNI criteria; etc.

Blacklisting involves a list of people along with a reason why they are blacklisted, regardless of my position as an artist, writer, stranger, or friend. If you're on this list, do not expect to be removed.

If alt accounts are made by any person within this list, I will find them accordingly and add them to the list. If you attempt to do this while being on my blacklist, please don't waste your time.

## DIRECTOR'S PASS & DISCOUNTS

"Director's Pass" is when you are given a discount on all services except for 24-hour turnarounds, mostly for certain reasons.

The following applies for a discount: Returning clients; holiday and birthday sales; etc.

To get "Director's Pass", you must have commissioned me at least 5 times before the discount is effectively applied. This can be stacked with any service.

For "Director's Pass", you must be a client who had placed a commission within the last 6 months. Once the time is up, the Pass stops being applied, to which returning clients can commission again for 2 returning ones before it is applied again, instead of 5.

"Director's Pass" clients can get up to 25% off, which does not apply / add up when I'm hosting a sale with the same percentage or higher.
