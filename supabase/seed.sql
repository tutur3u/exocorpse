    '# Exocorpse

Exocorpse is an underground corporation that operates in the shadows of society, striving to cleanse all of humanity''s sins through an unconventional method: by devoting themselves to being sinners. The organization believes that by taking on the world''s darkness, they can create a path toward a better future.

## Philosophy

The staff of Exocorpse perform missions that society deems immoral or illegal‚Äîheists, assassinations, bodyguard services, information manipulation‚Äîall in pursuit of what they believe is a noble goal. They operate under the philosophy that someone must bear the burden of sin so that others may live in the light.

## The Prototype System

The corporation has extreme interests in the biology and psychology of humanity, which has led to the development of two distinct branches, each specialized in different aspects of human potential:

### Prototype: Pulse
The branch designated for individuals who excel in physical strength, combat, agility, and brute force. Pulses are the frontliners of the corporation, executing direct action missions. They follow the rhythm of the heart‚Äîeach step calculated, each strategy precise.

### Prototype: Neuro
The branch designated for individuals who excel in intelligence, psychology, and manipulation. Neuros work in the background, pulling strings and orchestrating complex operations. They understand the dialects of the world and weave them into their plans.

## Structure

The corporation operates with military precision, divided into cells and divisions. Each member undergoes rigorous testing to determine their prototype classification, though some rare individuals show aptitude for both branches.',

This is our world, but beneath the surface of everyday life, shadow organizations like Exocorpse operate with impunity. Governments are aware of their existence but choose to turn a blind eye, recognizing that some jobs are too dirty for official channels.

## Geography

Exocorpse operates globally, with cells in every major city. Their headquarters is rumored to be somewhere in East Asia, hidden beneath layers of corporate fronts and misdirection.

## Society

Most citizens are unaware of Exocorpse''s existence. Those who know of it speak in whispers, and those who work for it rarely speak at all.'

Viktor Sokolov is a rarity in Exocorpse‚Äîa dual-type operative who excels in both physical and psychological operations. Born in Moscow to a family of academics and military officers, he was groomed from childhood to be exceptional.

He was recruited by Exocorpse at 23 after simultaneously completing special forces training and earning a master''s degree in Strategic Studies. His unique combination of skills caught the attention of Exocorpse''s founders, who saw in him the potential to bridge the gap between Pulse and Neuro.

## Rise to Power

Viktor quickly climbed the ranks, leading successful operations that required both direct action and psychological manipulation. By 30, he became one of Exocorpse''s youngest commanders.

## Current Role

Viktor now oversees joint operations between Pulse and Neuro divisions. He''s also leading a controversial program to identify and train more dual-type operatives, believing they represent the future of Exocorpse.

## Reputation

Among Pulse operatives, he''s respected for his combat prowess. Among Neuros, he''s admired for his strategic mind. Among both, he''s feared for his ruthlessness.',

    '# Understanding the Prototypes: Pulse vs Neuro

One of the most fundamental aspects of Exocorpse is the Prototype system‚Äîa classification that divides operatives into two primary branches based on their aptitudes and specializations.

## The Philosophy Behind Prototypes

The founders of Exocorpse believed that human potential comes in distinct forms. Rather than forcing all recruits into a single mold, they developed a system that identifies, nurtures, and specializes individuals according to their natural strengths.

## Prototype: Pulse

**Pulse operatives** are the physical embodiment of Exocorpse''s direct action capabilities. They are warriors, athletes, and tacticians.

### Selection Criteria
- Exceptional physical conditioning
- Combat proficiency (any discipline)
- Quick decision-making under pressure
- High pain tolerance
- Tactical thinking and adaptability

### Training Program
The Pulse training program lasts 2 years and is one of the most rigorous on Earth. Only 40% of applicants complete it.

### Specializations
- **Combat Operative**: Direct action, infiltration, extraction
- **Tactical Commander**: Planning and coordination
- **Close Protection**: VIP security and bodyguard services

### Notable Traits
- Exceptional physical conditioning
- Enhanced reflexes through training
- Superior pain tolerance
- Tactical analysis capabilities

## Prototype: Neuro

**Neuro operatives** are the architects of Exocorpse''s most complex operations, working in the shadows and pulling strings from behind the scenes.

### Selection Criteria
- Exceptional intelligence (typically IQ 140+)
- Advanced psychological understanding
- Pattern recognition abilities
- Social engineering skills
- Information synthesis capabilities

### Training Program
The Neuro training program lasts 3 years and focuses on psychology, cryptography, sociology, and manipulation techniques.

### Specializations
- **Intelligence Analyst**: Information gathering and analysis
- **Psychologist**: Interrogation and psychological profiling
- **Information Warfare Specialist**: Data manipulation and misinformation

### Notable Traits
- Eidetic memory
- Rapid pattern recognition
- Psychological profiling ability
- Advanced threat assessment

## Dual-Type Operatives (Rare)

In exceptional cases, an individual may demonstrate aptitude in both Pulse and Neuro disciplines. These dual-type operatives are extraordinarily rare‚Äîfewer than 10 are currently active.

Viktor Sokolov is one of the most famous examples of a dual-type operative, commanding joint operations between both divisions.

## Comparison Table

| Aspect | Pulse | Neuro |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Primary Focus | Physical Action | Information & Psychology |
| Training Duration | 2 years | 3 years |
| Completion Rate | 40% | 60% |
| Typical Role | Field Operations | Analysis & Planning |

    'The Philosophy of Exocorpse: Sin for Salvation',
    '# The Philosophy of Exocorpse: Sin for Salvation

At its core, Exocorpse is built on a singular, controversial philosophy: **Someone must bear the burden of sin so that others may live in the light.**

## The Founding Principle

In 2010, seven disillusioned operatives gathered beneath Tokyo with a radical idea. They believed that:

1. **Governments are inefficient** - Bureaucracy prevents necessary action
2. **Morality is a luxury** - When lives are at stake, rules must bend
3. **The greater good justifies the means** - Sometimes dirty work prevents greater harm
4. **Shadow work is noble** - Those who do it sacrifice their souls for civilization

## Core Tenets

### Tenet 1: Necessary Evil

Not all targets deserve death. Not all means are justified. But when the choice is between one murder and a genocide, Exocorpse believes in the murder.

The organization operates in the moral gray zone, accepting contracts that governments cannot acknowledge but desperately need executed.

### Tenet 2: The Sacrifice

Members of Exocorpse understand they are sacrificing their souls for the greater good. Each mission taken, each life ended, each psyche manipulated‚Äîall are burdens the operative bears so civilians need not.

### Tenet 3: Purpose Over Profit

While Exocorpse is well-funded, its primary motivation is not money. It is the belief that their work matters, that their sacrifices have meaning.

### Tenet 4: Perfection in Execution

If you must sin, sin perfectly. Sloppy work causes collateral damage. Precise work achieves objectives cleanly. Exocorpse demands excellence.

### Tenet 5: Selective Recruitment

Not everyone can bear the weight of this work. Exocorpse recruits only the strongest‚Äîphysically and psychologically‚Äîunderstanding that weak links lead to mission failure and innocent deaths.

## The Criticism

Of course, this philosophy is controversial. Critics argue:

- **It''s moral relativism**: Who decides what counts as "necessary"?
- **It breeds corruption**: Power to decide who lives and dies is inherently corrupting
- **It''s cult-like**: The philosophy asks for absolute belief and sacrifice
- **It justifies atrocity**: Any evil can be justified as "necessary"

Exocorpse members acknowledge these criticisms but maintain their conviction that perfect isn''t possible in a broken world.

## In Practice

This philosophy manifests as:

- **Surgical precision**: Kill only the target, never the innocent
- **Psychological fortitude**: Accept the weight of your actions
- **Mission before self**: Personal wants mean nothing compared to objectives
- **Loyalty above all**: Trust your team completely or don''t work
- **Constant questioning**: Never become comfortable; always question if you''re on the right side
