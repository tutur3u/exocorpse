    '# Exocorpse

Exocorpse is an underground corporation that operates in the shadows of society, striving to cleanse all of humanity''s sins through an unconventional method: by devoting themselves to being sinners. The organization believes that by taking on the world''s darkness, they can create a path toward a better future.

## Philosophy

The staff of Exocorpse perform missions that society deems immoral or illegal‚Äîheists, assassinations, bodyguard services, information manipulation‚Äîall in pursuit of what they believe is a noble goal. They operate under the philosophy that someone must bear the burden of sin so that others may live in the light.

## The Prototype System

The corporation has extreme interests in the biology and psychology of humanity, which has led to the development of two distinct branches, each specialized in different aspects of human potential:

### Prototype: Pulse
The branch designated for individuals who excel in physical strength, combat, agility, and brute force. Pulses are the frontliners of the corporation, executing direct action missions. They follow the rhythm of the heart‚Äîeach step calculated, each strategy precise.

### Prototype: Neuro
The branch designated for individuals who excel in intelligence, psychology, and manipulation. Neuros work in the background, pulling strings and orchestrating complex operations. They understand the dialects of the world and weave them into their plans.

## Structure

The corporation operates with military precision, divided into cells and divisions. Each member undergoes rigorous testing to determine their prototype classification, though some rare individuals show aptitude for both branches.',

This is our world, but beneath the surface of everyday life, shadow organizations like Exocorpse operate with impunity. Governments are aware of their existence but choose to turn a blind eye, recognizing that some jobs are too dirty for official channels.

## Geography

Exocorpse operates globally, with cells in every major city. Their headquarters is rumored to be somewhere in East Asia, hidden beneath layers of corporate fronts and misdirection.

## Society

Most citizens are unaware of Exocorpse''s existence. Those who know of it speak in whispers, and those who work for it rarely speak at all.'

Kazuki was recruited from the Japanese Self-Defense Forces after displaying exceptional combat abilities during a joint training exercise. He completed Pulse training in record time and quickly rose through the ranks.

Born in Osaka, he lost his family in a gang-related incident when he was 16. He joined the military seeking purpose and found it in Exocorpse''s mission.

Viktor Sokolov is a rarity in Exocorpse‚Äîa dual-type operative who excels in both physical and psychological operations. Born in Moscow to a family of academics and military officers, he was groomed from childhood to be exceptional.

He was recruited by Exocorpse at 23 after simultaneously completing special forces training and earning a master''s degree in Strategic Studies. His unique combination of skills caught the attention of Exocorpse''s founders, who saw in him the potential to bridge the gap between Pulse and Neuro.

## Rise to Power

Viktor quickly climbed the ranks, leading successful operations that required both direct action and psychological manipulation. By 30, he became one of Exocorpse''s youngest commanders.

## Current Role

Viktor now oversees joint operations between Pulse and Neuro divisions. He''s also leading a controversial program to identify and train more dual-type operatives, believing they represent the future of Exocorpse.

## Reputation

Among Pulse operatives, he''s respected for his combat prowess. Among Neuros, he''s admired for his strategic mind. Among both, he''s feared for his ruthlessness.',
